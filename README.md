Thank you for your interest in my application. This is Van Excel Panguito.

This README provides instructions for setting up and running the application for the technical examination.

Setup Instructions
Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder.
Run the command php artisan serve to start the Laravel server.
Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend folder.
Run the command npm install to install the required dependencies.
After installation, run npm run dev to start the frontend development server.
Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application by opening your browser and navigating to the appropriate URLs:

Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api
Frontend Development Server: http://localhost:8080 (or the appropriate port assigned by npm run dev)
Note
Make sure to have PHP, Laravel, Node.js, and npm installed on your system before following the setup instructions.

For any issues or questions, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
